- ✅ Arrays, slices, and maps
- ✅ Loops & conditionals
- ✅ Structs & interfaces
- ✅ Goroutines & concurrency
- ✅ File I/O and HTTP
- 🔄 In Progress: REST APIs & Go modules

## 🧠 Why Go?

- ⚡ Lightning-fast performance (compiled language)
- 🧵 Built-in concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- 📦 Easy to deploy (single binary)
- 📚 Clean syntax with strong typing
- 💼 Used by big companies: Google, Uber, Twitch, Dropbox, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Using

- Code Editor: VS Code
- Formatter: `go fmt`
- Package Manager: Go Modules
- Playground: [Go.dev/play](https://go.dev/play/)
- Linter: `golint` (optional)

## 📌 Sample Code Snippet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("🚀 Hello, Golang World!")
}
````

## 🚀 What's Next?

* [ ] Build a CLI app using Cobra
* [ ] Create a simple REST API
* [ ] Explore Go with WebSockets / gRPC
* [ ] Connect with PostgreSQL using GORM
* [ ] Use Go for blockchain tooling / Web3
